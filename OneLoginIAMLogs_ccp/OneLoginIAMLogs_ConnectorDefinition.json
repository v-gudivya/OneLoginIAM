The OneLogin Event Webhook API which is also known as the Event Broadcaster will send batches of events in near real-time to an endpoint that you specify. When a change occurs in the OneLogin, an HTTPS POST request with event information is sent to a callback data connector URL. Refer to [Webhooks documentation](https://developers.onelogin.com/api-docs/1/events/webhooks) for more information. The connector provides ability to get events which helps to examine potential security risks, analyze your team's use of collaboration, diagnose configuration problems and more.",
